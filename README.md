# Artgorithms

### https://artgorithms.vercel.com

Inspired by exhibitions at the SFMOMA and Bret Victor's [Inventing on Principle talk](https://vimeo.com/36579366), this project aims to recreate the artwork in code and alogrithms.
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel
